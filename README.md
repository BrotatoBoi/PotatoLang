# PotatoLang
A custom programming language I am making. It is simple to use and has the extension of <em>.pot</em>

# Usage:
To use my language it is currently only available through the interpreter, which is called 'Interpre-tato'.
</br> 
<code>python3 Interpre-tato.py</code>
</br>
<code>run [FILE]</code>

# Documentation
There will be updates so there will be more in the future!

Starting a line with <code>$</code> means it is a comment and gets ignored by the interpreter.
</br>
To create a variable use the line has to read: <code>set [VARIABLE NAME] [VALUE]</code>
</br>
To print text to the screen the line should be: <code>say "[MESSAGE]" [VARIABLE]</code>
</br>
To get user input: <code>get [VARIABLE NAME] [MESSAGE]</code>

  
# Notes:
  You may notice I end comment with another '$' at the end but that is just to make it look nice.
