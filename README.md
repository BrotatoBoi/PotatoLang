# PotatoLangV0.2.2R2
A custom programming language I am making. It is simple to use and has the extension of <var>.pot</var>

# Usage:
To use my language it is currently only available through the interpreter, which is called <em>'Interpre-tato'</em>.
</br> 
<code>python3 Interpre-tato.py</code>
</br>
<code>run [FILE]</code>

# Documentation
You can find the documentation >>[HERE](https://brotatoboi.github.io/PotatoLang/documentation.html)<<

# Notes:
  * You can check the [examples folder](https://github.com/BrotatoBoi/PotatoLang/Examples) for an indepth code usage.

  * You can have the if/else <var>[CODE]</var> block do multiple things if you seperate them with a <var>' ; '</var>

  * The if/else statement is extreamly basic and can only handle one set of conditions and the only operator is <var>'equals'</var>
