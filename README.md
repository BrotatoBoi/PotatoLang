# PotatoLang
A custom programming language I am making. It is simple to use and has the extension of <em>.pot</em>

# Usage:
To use my language it is currently only available through the interpreter, which is called 'Interpre-tato'.
</br> 
<code>python3 Interpre-tato.py</code>
</br>
<code>run [FILE]</code>
